# The Concatenated words challenge
We have provided a file called “wordsforproblem.txt” which contains a sorted list of approximately 173,000 words. The words are listed one word per line, do not contain spaces, and are all lowercase. Your task is to write a program that reads the file and provides the following:
* the longest concatenated word (that is, the longest word that is comprised entirely of shorter
 words in the file)
* the 2nd longest concatenated word
* the total count of all the concatenated words in the file

For example, if the file contained:
````
cat
cats
catsdogcats
dog
dogcatsdog
hippopotamuses
rat
ratcatdogcat
````

The longest concatenated word would be **“ratcatdogcat”**; with 12 characters. **‘hippopotamuses
’** is a longer word, however it is not comprised entirely of shorter words in the list.

The 2nd longest concatenated word is **“catsdogcats”** with 11 characters.

The total number of concatenated words is 3. Note that ‘cats’ is not a concatenated word because there is no word ‘s’ in the list.
